# basic_ml

- Basic gradient descent algorithms. It is useful for different types of regression.
- The implementations in this project are the result of my learnings from Andrew Ng's course on Coursera. So, it is a good starting point for intuition, if you like to look under the hood of gradiend descent-based machine learning algorithms.
- Take a look at the samples.py file to get an overview of the algorithms.

# Requirements:
1. Python 3.4.*
